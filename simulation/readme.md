# This "simulation" folder consists of the code and dataset for simulating SLAM-TKA.



To run the code, please refer to the following steps:

(1) Download the **simulation** folder to your local computer;


(2) Go to the [SDF_prior_calculation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BLcZbM97nJQBNxSFOZ_RaUZHATfTdymR?usp=sharing) to download the pre-computed SDF and put them in your local foler "SDF_prior_calculation";



(3) Open your MATLAB software and run ** Main_2D_3D_tsdf_overall.m **


---
**Tip**: The function "Main_2D_3D_tsdf_overall.m" will first takes some time to load the prior SDF data.




## The second way to run the code
Download all the files from
[X_ray_frames_and_pins_localization_simulation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MfKUdQvDxh42dJFqc75vg1yeor1AFvCH?usp=sharing) into your local computer, then Open MATLAB and run The function ** Main_2D_3D_tsdf_overall.m **
