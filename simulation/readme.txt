This "simulation" folder consists of the code and dataset for simulating SLAM-TKA.

To run the code, open your MATLAB and run " Main_2D_3D_tsdf_overall.m "

The function "Main_2D_3D_tsdf_overall.m" will first takes some time to load the prior SDF data.

If the foler "#SDF_prior_calculation#"


The second way is download the code and dataset 


The first one is go to the link and download the file from the GoogleDrive link, open your MATLAB and run Main_2D_3D_tsdf_overall.m;
